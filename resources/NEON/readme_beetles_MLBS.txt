"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10022.001"
"Name: Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps"
"Description: Taxonomically identified ground beetles and the plots and times from which they were collected."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Observation System"
"Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's ground beetle sampling and specimen processing protocols. Ground beetle abundance and diversity are sampled via pitfall trapping at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites. Following trap collection, all beetles from the family Carabidae are sorted by NEON technicians and identified to species or morphospecies. A subset of collected Carabidae are pointed or pinned, while other specimens (non-pinned/non-pointed carabids, invertebrate bycatch, and vertebrate bycatch) are stored in 95% ethanol for archiving, and may be pooled into a single archive vial per plot. Regardless of storage method, all collections data are reported at a per trap resolution. A subset of pinned ground beetles (up to 467 per site per year) are sent to an expert taxonomist for secondary identification. Identifications performed on these individuals may be used to estimate uncertainty in parataxonomist identification by NEON technicians."

"Brief Design Description: Ground beetles are sampled using pitfall traps (16 oz deli containers filled with 150 or 250 mL of propylene glycol). Multiple traps are deployed in each of 10 plots at each terrestrial NEON site (from 2013-2017, 40 traps per site; 2018-present, 30 traps per site), with traps arrayed approximately 20 meters from the center of the plot in one of the four cardinal directions. Sampling occurs biweekly throughout the growing season (when temperatures are above 4 degrees C)."
"Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial sites."

"ISSUE LOG"
"----------"
"This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10022.001."
"Issue Date: 2022-09-13"
"Issue: Toolik Field Station required a quarantine period prior to starting work in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons to protect all personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complicated NEON field scheduling logistics, which typically involves repeated travel across the state on short time frames. Consequently, NEON reduced staffing traveling to Toolik and was thus unable to complete all planned sampling efforts. Missed data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field."

"Issue Date: 2022-09-13"
"Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Observational data collection was halted during this time. Canceled data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field."

"Resolution: "
"Issue Date: 2021-01-06"
"Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled sampling activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability may be reduced during this time."
"       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31"
"       Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-31"
"Resolution: The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection. Training procedures and data quality reviews were maintained throughout the pandemic, although some previously in-person training was conducted virtually.  Scheduled measurements and sampling that were not carried out due to COVID-19 or any other causes are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical data field."
"Issue Date: 2021-12-09"
"Issue: State-level taxa obfuscation: Prior to the 2022 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive at the state level where the observation was recorded. Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity."
"       Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2021-12-31"
"       Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-31"
"Resolution: The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites."
"Issue Date: 2021-12-09"
"Issue: EventID format updated: Prior to the 2022 data release, the eventID field in the `bet_fielddata` table had been created by concatenating the siteID, year, and ISO week of the sample collectDate. Using the collectDate in the eventID has created inconsistencies when making comparisons across samples of different trapping durations."
"       Date Range: 2013-07-01 to 2021-12-09"
"       Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-09"
"Resolution: Starting in the 2022 data release the eventID will be based on the ISO week of the pitfall trap setDate. All eventIDs for existing data have been updated to reflect this change for the 2022 data release."
"Issue Date: 2020-03-10"
"Issue: No sampling impractical: Before 2020, each bout of collection would have up to 40 records (collection years 2013-2017) or 30 records (collection years 2018-2019) in the `bet_trapping` table. In cases where fewer than the maximum number of records were generated per bout, this reflects lower levels of sampling effort and additional records should not be expected."
"       Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2020-03-10"
"       Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites"
"Resolution Date: 2020-03-10"
"Resolution: In 2020, NEON added the quality flag \"samplingImpractical\" to the `bet_trapping` table in this data product to assist users in understanding when data for this product are temporarily missing versus permanently unavailable. Beginning in 2020, there will *always* be one record generated per scheduled pitfall trap in the `bet_trapping` table."
"Issue Date: 2018-01-01"
"Issue: Reduced sampling: The original beetle sampling design accommodated 40 pitfall traps deployed within 10 plot locations (4 traps per plot; 10 plots per site) and up to 40 samples could be generated per site per bout. In 2018, reductions in sampling were necessary due to budget limitations (both the field sampling and analytical budgets)."
"       Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2018-01-01"
"       Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites"
"Resolution Date: 2018-01-01"
"Resolution: Beginning in 2018, the sampling design was altered to eliminate one trap cup from each plot, resulting in reduced sampling per bout (3 traps per plot; 10 plots per site); this change resulted in a maximum of 30 samples generated per site per bout. The change in sampling effort reduced the number of samples generated during a bout; requiring a reduced budget for analytical costs to analyze samples (for species composition)."
"Issue Date: 2017-08-15"
"Issue: Different data fields: As part of NEON's ongoing construction tasks, the processing pipeline for most data products for NEON's observational systems (terrestrial [TOS] and aquatic [AOS]) has been simplified to use a generic codebase."
"       Date Range: 2017-08-15 to 2017-08-15"
"       Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites"
"Resolution Date: 2017-08-15"
"Resolution: Data that were published previously have been reprocessed and republished using the generic code -- replacing data that had been processed using the original algorithms described in Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs). Consequently, data are in a new format including, in many cases, different data fields. Details of the new processing pipeline can be found in http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/OS_generic_transitions_vA  and http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/Nicl_Language_DRAFT.  Additionally, manual QA of all existing beetle data was performed to rectify mismatches between field collected samples and downstream tables (sorting, pinning, and expert id)."
"Issue Date: 2015-11-23"
"Issue: Different data fields: Early protocols treated carabids along two workflows, based on the difficulty in the identification of beetle taxa. Those early data are annotated in the `bet_sorting` table where the field sampleType has a value of 'common carabid' or 'other carabid'. Records with a sampleType of 'common carabid' were treated functionally the same as the current protocol. Where sampleType = 'other carabid', users must look in the `bet_parataxonomistID` table for fine-scale taxonomy. Records in the `bet_sorting` table using the 'other carabid' processing workflow were only annotated with 'Carabidae sp.' in the `bet_sorting` table and all finer scale information was entered into the `bet_parataxonomistID` table."
"       Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2015-11-23"
"       Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites"
"Resolution Date: 2015-11-23"
"Resolution: Many users found it confusing to have to collate taxonomic information from two tables, so NEON updated the procedure (NEON.DOC.014050; protocol version J and later) to consolidate all NEON staff taxonomic determinations into one table (`bet_sorting`). Taxonomy will continue to be provided in the `bet_parataxonomistID` table, but this table is primarily retained to communicate the identifiers of pinned beetles and allow users to perform table joining with determinations made by taxonomic experts (`bet_expertTaxonomistIDProcessed`)."
"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"----------------------"
"Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published. "
"The protocol dictates that each trap is collected once per bout (one expected record per trapID per plotID per collectDate in `bet_fielddata`). A record from `bet_fielddata` may have zero (if no sample collected) or multiple child records in `bet_sorting` depending on number of taxa contained in the sampleID. A record from from `bet_sorting` may have zero (if no contents of the subsampleID pinned) or multiple child records in `bet_parataxonomistID` depending on the number of individuals selected for pinning from each subsampleID. A record in `bet_archivepooling` may correspond to one or more records in `bet_sorting`, because multiple subsampleIDs may have been pooled into a single archiveVial. Each record in `bet_parataxonomistID` should have zero or one corresponding records in `bet_expertTaxonomistIDProcessed`, depending on whether that individualID was selected for professional identification. Each record in `bet_parataxonomistID` should also have zero or one corresponding records in `bet_expertTaxonomistIDRaw`. All beetles must be sorted prior to pinning, so the total number of beetles collected can be calculated as the sum of individualCount in `bet_sorting`, though further identifications may be updated based on the downstream workflow. Taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed'; see data package readme files for more information."
