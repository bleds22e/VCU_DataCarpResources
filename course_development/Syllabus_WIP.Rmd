# Data Carpentry for Undergraduate Biology Students

## Course Description

From Catherine's Class:

Data are essential to the study of ecology and the environment. Big data (such as data generated by satellites orbiting Earth, billions of biological specimens in natural history museums, and thousands of wildlife camera photographs, to name a few) are disrupting a wide range of industries from human health and environmental monitoring to conservation and government policy. The explosion of data is providing unprecedented opportunities for new discovery and applications. As a result, data skills are in high demand for entering data without errors, storing it in a usable and transparent way, extracting key aspects of the data for analysis, and creating accessible visual representations of large and complex datasets. This course will provide an introduction to fundamental data skills with an emphasis on environmental and ecological datasets. Class will typically consist of short introductions or question and answer sessions, followed by hands on exercises. The course will be taught using R (a popular programming language) and other data tools. No background in programming or data skills is required.

## Course Purpose

In this course you will learn fundamental data skills for research, for management and policy decisions, and for general data management in a variety of career settings. By the end of the course you will be able to develop a well-structured database, import data into R, use logical thinking to write computer programs to analyze data, and produce well designed data visualizations.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to do the following:

-   Apply best practices with spreadsheets to reduce potential data entry errors
-   
-   Create a computationally reproducible research project

Create well-structured databases Extract information from databases Write simple computer programs in R to analyze data and create visualizations Apply these tools to answer ecological and environmental questions using publicly available datasets
