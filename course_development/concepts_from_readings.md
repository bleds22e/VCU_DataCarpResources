A rough-and-ready document for general concepts in data science pedagogy
to be employed in the Data Carpentry for Biologists (undergraduate)
course.

Citations for many of the concepts are included below.

# Key Concepts

## Pedagogy

-   Peer instruction
-   Early win
-   Real data
-   Team-based learning techniques
-   Assignment and assessments prepare students for final project

## Data Science & Pedagogy

-   Literate programming
-   Real data
-   RMarkdown (including templates at the beginning)
-   Start clean and tidy, then talk about data wrangling and tidying,
    then data import
-   Let them eat cake…first (early win)
-   Tidyverse to maximize readability

# Annotations

“Peer instruction is a pedagogical technique, which has been emphasized
in physics for over 20 years, and is well documented as increasing the
students’ conceptual understanding of topics
6
. It is increasingly used in computer science
7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21
. Under peer instruction, throughout the lecture, students are given a
multiple-choice question, with one correct answer and two to four
distractor answers. They first vote individually on an answer, typically
by using an electronic clicker device
4
. They then discuss the question in small, assigned groups, and after a
brief discussion, the group votes on a single answer. Peer instruction
is effective in developing cross-disciplinary communication skills in an
interdisciplinary setting
11
, one of the goals of the course.” ([Berger-Wolf et al., 2018,

“In addition, use of real data is a pillar of this course. Not only is
this strongly recommended in Carver et al. (2016), but it also equips
students with the tools to answer questions of their own choosing as
part of their end-of-semester project” ([Çetinkaya-Rundel and Ellison,
2021, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/4541885/items/7V3GCIQK))
([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4541885/items/7Z5XJLCJ?page=5&annotation=GMBH3K8W))

“We call this the “let them eat cake first” approach, where students
first see an example of a complex data visualization, which they will be
able to build by the end of this unit, and then slowly work their way
through the building blocks (ÇetinkayaRundel 2018). This approach is
also presented in Wang, Rush, and Horton (2017), which advocates for
“bringing big ideas into intro stats early and often.””

“As suggested by the literature (Michaelsen and Sweet 2011), we employ
several team-based learning techniques to address the challenges of
keeping a large lecture hall of students with varying degrees of
background knowledge both challenged and engaged.” ([Çetinkaya-Rundel
and Ellison, 2021,
p. 22](zotero://select/groups/4541885/items/7V3GCIQK))

“Building on literate programming (Knuth 1984), R Markdown provides an
easy-to-use authoring framework for combining statistical computing and
written analysis in one computational document that includes the
narrative, code, and the output of an analysis (Xie, Allaire, and
Grolemund 2018).” ([Çetinkaya-Rundel and Ellison, 2021,

“Thisprocessofan early win is made possible with R Markdown in a way
that would be much harder to accomplish typing code in the console or
even with the use of a reproducible R script. We are able to introduce
students to R Markdown before any formal R instruction thanks to the
very lightweight syntax of the markdown language, and by providing a
fully functional document that is guaranteed to knit and display results
for each student regardless of their personal computing setup.”

“Tidyverse code is not necessarily concise, but the course aims to teach
students to maximize readability and extensibility of their code instead
of minimizing the number of lines to accomplish a task.”

“Many of the assignments and assessments in the course are designed to
prepare students for the final project, which, in a nutshell, asks
students to “Pick a dataset, any dataset, and do something with it.””
